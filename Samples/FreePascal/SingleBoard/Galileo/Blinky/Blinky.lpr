  This example illustrates how to blink a LED on Intel Galileo.

  Attention! Please follow these instructions before running the sample:

   1. PinLED constant should contain pin number to which positive LED terminal is connected to.

   2. After compiling and uploading this sample, change its attributes to executable. Something like this:
        chmod +x Blinky
        ./Blinky

   3. Check the accompanying diagram and photo to see an example on how the wiring should be made.
