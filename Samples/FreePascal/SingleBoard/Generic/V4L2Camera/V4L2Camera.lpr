  This example illustrates how to take a snapshot from V4L2-compatible webcam.

  Attention! Please follow these instructions before running the sample:

   1. Make sure your V4L2-compliant camera is connected and working properly.
      You can verify that your camera is present and available by using v4l2-ctl tool, e.g.:
        v4l2-ctl --list-devices
        v4l2-ctl --list-formats-ext

   2. When creating TV4L2Camera class, make sure that Linux path (by default /dev/video0) is correct.

   3. After compiling and uploading this sample, change its attributes to executable. It is also recommended to
      execute this application with administrative privileges. Something like this:
        chmod +x V4L2Camera
        sudo ./V4L2Camera

        reported by V4L2 driver are realistically supported, resulting in all kind of weird issues. }
