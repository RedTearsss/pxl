  This example illustrates how to blink a LED using Sysfs GPIO interface.

  Attention! Please follow these instructions before running the sample:

   1. When creating TSysfsGPIO class, make sure that Linux path (by default /sys/class/gpio) to GPIO is correct.

   2. PinLED constant should contain actual Linux GPIO number corresponding to physical pin.

   3. On some devices, before using pins for GPIO, it is necessary to set one or more multiplexers. Refer to the
      manual of your specific device for the information on how to do this. In many cases, you can use the same GPIO
      class to do it, e.g. "GPIO.SetMux(24, TPinValue.High)".

   4. After compiling and uploading this sample, change its attributes to executable. It is also recommended to
      execute this application with administrative privileges. Something like this:
        chmod +x Blinky
        sudo ./Blinky

   5. Check the accompanying diagram and photo to see an example on how this can be connected on BeagleBone Black.
      Note that for BeagleBone Black, check tables on pages 70 and 72 from "BeagleBone Black System Reference Manual"
      to determine actual GPIO number. In this case, pin P9_12 in Mode7 corresponds to "gpio1[28]" and since each
      "gpio" is offset by 32 starting from zero, the actual pin number is 1 * 32 + 28 = 60.
